# Project Synopsis

This experimental study involved testing and analyzing the effects of common microplastic material on Yellow Shore Crabs. Our group referenced prior studies that tested these effects, and our hypothesis postulated that High-Density Polyethylene and Polypropelyne 
would have an effect.
